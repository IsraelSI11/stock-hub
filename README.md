# StockHub

A basic web application made with Angular 18 and Spring, created to help manage and track storage over time. I developed this project as a way to practice and improve my skills with Angular while exploring its core features and functionality.


## Installation/Dev

Launch web client

```bash
  cd frontend/
  npm install
  npm start
```

Launch backend

The same process as starting a Springboot application.
    
## Environment Variables

In the `application.properties` file, make sure the PostgreSQL database configuration is correct. Also, ensure that the frontend URL is properly set.
